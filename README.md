# OracleBot
by Sublockdown


### To use
Either create an images folder manually, or by running the program it will detect and make one. Then just fill it with the images of the Oracle cards you want to use.

To Run:

        python oraclebot.py

This will create the .env file, which then you need to put in the token, server, and who you want to be admins. Then, run it again, and it should connect.

This section will be expanded upon, and include a howto for getting the token and what permissions to assign. 

To get a reading, anyone can instead type ?reading
To restart, anyone in the admin list can type ?restart

### TODO
----------------------------------------
* Have it create private threads for each reading
* Have it create indivudal decks for each reading
